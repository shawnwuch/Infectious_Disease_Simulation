This directory contains the files for the final project of SDS392 Intro. to Sci. Programming -- Infectuous Disease.
There are a total of 6 exercises, ex1, ex2 ... ex6. The source codes are included in this folder, and you can use 'make exN' to build 
each of the exercise, where N is the number of exercise you want to build. Ex. 'make ex1' will build exercise one and create a binary named 'main'.

Below are the descriptions for each of the exercise:
	ex1: This exercise implements the person class with a display mechanism showing the person's health status.
	ex2: This exercise implements the population class and a display mechanism showing the health status of each person in the population.
	ex3: This exercise implements the disease transmission function to directly adjacent neighbors in a 1-D space.
	ex4: This exercise is the first implementation of random disease transmission upon contact -- with specified number of contacted people.
	ex5: This file is an extension of ex4, with two for loops and a file output mechanism added for investigating the length of disease run with respect 
	     to disease transfer probability and inoculation fraction of a group of people.
	ex6: This file is an extension of ex5, with a probability_of_vaccine_effectiveness implemented to investigate the length of disease run under the circumstances
		 where the vaccine is only partly effective.

There are two additional files included in this directory:
	1. plot_data.m: A Matlab script I used to generate the plots for my final report.
	2. final_report.pdf: A summary of my investigations in this infectuous disease final project.
